<p>When you store your babys cord blood, you are storing an important medical resource. As of 2014, there have been over 1 million Hematopoietic stem cell transplants and 30,000 cord blood transplants performed worldwide, and that number is increasing every day. .</p>
<blockquote><p>Protecting babys health. A baby using his or her own cord blood will always be a 100% match for his or her own stem cells. However, sometimes families are unable to collect cord blood from the first child, and some diseases are genetic, making using ones own cord blood inept.</p></blockquote>
<p>Siblings looking out for each other. In some situations, a cord blood transplant from a donor, such as a sibling, may be required, and there is a higher chance of survival when using stem cells from a related donor. Siblings or other family members that are a close enough HLA match can benefit from the cord blood. There is a 25% chance that a sibling will be a perfect HLA match, a 50% chance that they will be a partial match, and a 25% chance that they will be no match at all. Banking multiple childrens cord blood increases the chance that cord blood will be a match in case a transplant is required.
