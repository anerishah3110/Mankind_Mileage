<p>After your baby is born and before the placenta is delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the same as it would be for any normal delivery. The cord is rigorously cleaned to ensure a sterile collection, and then the cord blood is collected by your healthcare professional. All necessary materials for collecting and shipping are contained in the collection kit sent to the parents, so the hospital does not need to provide any materials.</p>
<blockquote><p>The collection is done by inserting a sterile needle into the umbilical vein and allowing gravity to drain the blood into a collection bag. The collection bag is a closed system, which is preferred by transplant physicians because it minimizes the risk of bacterial and fungal contamination.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Collection Kit :Temperature is an important factor in maintaining the cells in transport and storage. StemCyte provides an insulated collection kit that can maintain the correct temperature of your valuable cord blood cells in the most challenging scenarios. Our kit was validated against ISTE standards.
